## DISCRIBE WHAT A LIST IS?

- A list is a data structure that is ordered in a sequence of elements one below or after the other . all elements of a grouped data or information that is ordered it is called an item in a list.

- A list is defined by having a grouped data in between the squre [] blackets and elements gathered is separated by commas. A list can contain any number or amount of collected data and of different type be is they are strings,intergers,float or boolenn can still be a list even with a list inside a list and it is called a nested list.

- example of a list;

  max = [2,7,"mike","john",5,1,8,-333,7000]  

  like for this example of mixed data in a list it is a list of strings, intergers an float stored in one list
                                                

### How can you know that this is a list?

You can easly identify a list through the squre blackets []. As it is a storage of collected and ordered data elements, each present elements is separated by the commas (,).


### How to find the data in a list?

To find the exasctry element in a list index method is used as a reference and give an output of the spacefied item. 

Example

My_list [[2,3,4,5],['jeff','mark'],['lusaka','choma']]
print(my_list[1][2])

### DICTIONARY IN PYTHON

A dictionary is a storage or a container of elements. Every collected data in a dictionary has a key and a value (key/value). Dictionaries a are set up to search the information by the value when the key is there.
Dictionaries are written inside the carly blaces {} and separated the commas(,). When whriting a dictionary inside the arranged curly brackets{} the full colon (:) is placed in betweeen the key and the vslue to separate them and always a key if it is a string should be quoted in the inveted commas. A key can be a string, an integer, a loalt etc...Y can only access a dictionaly though a key to produce or unlock the reviewment of its answering data value.

### Example of a dictionary

fredrick = {"name":"fredrick","age":42,"nationality":"zambian"}
print(fredrick["age"])


Every programming languagehas its well ordered or known set of rules respecting formal spellings,punpunctuations, naming of variables, etc. The seted rules are accespted only in a stated woy or form and must be respected by the programmer. In every corrected data when printed or run it will review an outcome according to how the data was prepared, if the program has been typed wrongly those ignored problems will result to errors. e.g from the above EXAMPLE ,you comand a computer to print the age which is not quoted an error will occur to show or give a comment of a mistake made meaning you are out of respective seted rules. We have errors like;
 -Keyerror which come as a result of accessing non available key in that dictionary.
 -Typerror it apears showing that an incorect/wrong data has been typed.
 -Indexerror which comes when trying to access the information is not present.

### Example

-Punctuation mistakes i.e if the programer could miss the correct punctuation on the right time e.g misplacing of a comma or semicolon an errow will occur to propery give a signal where the programer miswritten the program.
-incorrect naming of a vailable also display an error e.g at first you write a vailable which name (my_family) when when you want printing it you type (myfamily) without an underscore, an error will occur to show that the vailables are different.

 ### PYTHON NESTED DICTIONARY

 A nested ditionary in python is a data dictionary in a onother dictionary. it ia a group of picked dictionaries and combined together (meaning nested dictionary) each one having its own key and also its 
 value.

 ### Example of a nested dictionary

 namm = {'myfamily':[{"child1" : {
     "name" : "elton",
     "year" : 2000
     },"child2" : {
    "name" : "mwiya",
    "year" : 2008
     },
"child3" : {
    "name" : "mwansa",
    "year" : 2019
    }},{}]}
print(namm["myfamily"][1])

Every programming languagehas its well ordered or known set of rules respecting formal spellings,punpunctuations, naming of variables, etc. The set rules are accespted only in a stated woy or form and must be respected by the programmer. In every corrected data when printed or run it will review an outcome according to how the data was prepared, if the program has been typed wrongly those ignored problems will result to errors. e.g from the above EXAMPLE ,you comand a computer to print the age which is not quoted an error will occur to show or give a comment of a mistake made meaning you are out of respective seted rules.

-incorrect naming of a vailable also display an error e.g at first you write a vailable which name (my_family) when when you want printing it you type (myfamily) without an underscore, an error will occur to show that the vailables are not the same.

# CS50 conditionals

Conditional statements are expressions that allows the programer to make ddecitions and take different forks in the road, depending on the vaues of variables or user input.
-Conditional statements works with mathematical symbols that plays a role of asking questions.
Symbols like; 
<  greater than symbol
<=  greater than or equal to symbol
>  less that symbol
>= less than or equal to symbol 
== equal to compirering two things left to right 
!= not equal to  

the conditional always compires the right given 
 
 # If statement

 -If statement plays a role of providing decitions in order to direct the programer to provide result based on a specified standards. eg

       a = int(input("What's a? "))
       b = int(input("What's b? "))

       if a < b:
        print("a is less than b")
In this i have two variables a and b for each one of them has its own values. For me to have a decisio made on my variables, i have to bring up if function and the  symbols a mathematical symbol to ask the question the other way round. Int will turn the laters of my variables to its character as integer

       if a < b then as (:)
       ....print ("a is less than b")
       meaning ("1 < 2")

If statements use a pair of true or false which is a boolin to decide whether or not to execute. If the statement of a b is true, the compiler will register it as true and execute the code.
